# naughtypy

naughtypy is a little ugly program drunk written in python that gets a random comment from a random pornhub video. Also, I've made a tumblr bot that posts these comments at http://porn--quotes.tumblr.com/
Don't judge, there are many mind blowing comments that you'll see. 

## You need to have BeautifulSoup installed to use it:

	$ pip install bs4

## And you run it with: 

	$ python naughtypy.py

If you want just to get comments without posting them to tumblr, just set the bot variable to False and run it.

## Leaderboard:

* I almost came and then he spit in her mouth

## Known bugs:
* sometimes it just crashes (dooh, I was drunk)
